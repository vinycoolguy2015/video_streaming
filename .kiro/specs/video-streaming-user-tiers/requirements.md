# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification defines the requirements for updating the existing video streaming platform to implement a three-tier user subscription system with manual video upload workflow and automated transcoding. The system will provide differentiated video access based on user subscription levels, with automatic video processing triggered by S3 uploads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Manual Video Upload Workflow

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to manually upload MP4 files to S3 so that the system can automatically process them for different user tiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MP4 file is uploaded to the S3 upload bucket THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a MediaConvert job
2. WHEN the MediaConvert job is triggered THEN the system SHALL create three different quality versions of the video
3. WHEN video processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store the processed videos in the appropriate S3 folders
4. WHEN video processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and update the video status accordingly

### Requirement 2: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up and login via Cognito so that I can access video content based on my subscription tier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create a Cognito user account with email verification
2. WHEN a user selects a subscription type during signup THEN the system SHALL store the subscription type as a custom attribute
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them via Cognito and retrieve their subscription type
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the authentication page

### Requirement 3: Three-Tier User Access Control

**User Story:** As a user with different subscription levels, I want to access video content appropriate to my subscription tier so that I receive the value I'm paying for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free user plays a video THEN the system SHALL show only the first 10 seconds before displaying an upgrade prompt
2. WHEN a standard user plays a video THEN the system SHALL provide full video access in 480p quality
3. WHEN a premium user plays a video THEN the system SHALL provide full video access with selectable quality (720p or 1080p)
4. WHEN any user attempts to access content above their tier THEN the system SHALL display an upgrade prompt
5. WHEN a user upgrades their subscription THEN the system SHALL immediately update their access level

### Requirement 4: Automated Video Transcoding

**User Story:** As the system, I want to automatically transcode uploaded videos into multiple formats so that different user tiers can access appropriate quality levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL create a 480p version for standard users
2. WHEN a video is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL create a 720p version for premium users
3. WHEN a video is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL create a 1080p version for premium users
4. WHEN a video is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL create a 10-second preview version for free users
5. WHEN transcoding is complete THEN the system SHALL generate thumbnail images for the video library
6. WHEN transcoding fails THEN the system SHALL retry the job once and log any persistent failures

### Requirement 5: Video Streaming and Delivery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stream videos smoothly based on my subscription level so that I have a good viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a video THEN the system SHALL serve the appropriate quality based on their subscription tier
2. WHEN a free user reaches the 10-second limit THEN the system SHALL pause playback and show an upgrade modal
3. WHEN a premium user selects video quality THEN the system SHALL switch to the requested quality level
4. WHEN video streaming fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry the request
5. WHEN a user has slow internet THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality to prevent buffering

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface that clearly shows my subscription benefits and limitations so that I understand the value of upgrading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display their current subscription type prominently
2. WHEN a free user encounters the 10-second limit THEN the system SHALL show a clear upgrade call-to-action
3. WHEN a premium user is watching a video THEN the system SHALL provide quality selection controls
4. WHEN any user browses the video library THEN the system SHALL show video thumbnails and metadata
5. WHEN a user's subscription expires THEN the system SHALL downgrade their access and notify them

### Requirement 7: Content Management and Metadata

**User Story:** As the system, I want to track video metadata and processing status so that I can provide accurate information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store metadata including title, duration, and upload date
2. WHEN video processing begins THEN the system SHALL update the status to "processing"
3. WHEN video processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the status to "available" and store video URLs
4. WHEN a user requests video information THEN the system SHALL return metadata appropriate to their subscription tier
5. WHEN video processing fails THEN the system SHALL update the status to "failed" and log the error details
